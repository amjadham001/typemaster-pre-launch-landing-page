## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Lessons learned from some of the pitfalls I encountered in this design:

- Clear separation of design parameters or properties (such as positioning, spacing, and main styles) across multiple layers helped keep the styling organized, maintainable, and easier to debug.
- Avoid context switching between layout layers or breakpoints prematurely â€” it's much more efficient to fully complete one layer or viewport before moving on to the next.

### Continued development

Area's that need development:

- Pixel perfect concept (especially in images)
- Separation of concerns (CoS) - Separation of layout

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This tool helped me to view and inspect the design in more detail such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, to get a perfect and consistent result.
